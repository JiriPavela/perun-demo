# perun-demo

This repository contains a various challenges and test projects meant for demonstration of the
capabilities of perun tool suite.

Prerequisite:

    pip3 install perun-toolsuite
    perun init

## Challenge 1

  - **Difficulty**: easy
  - **Goal**: Sort the complexities
  - **Description**: The speed of the sorting heavily depends on the input workloads as well as the
      algorithm. In the directory, there is a program that takes input file and sorts it. There are
      several implementation of different algorithms (Quick Sort, Merge Sort and Bubblesort). Find
      the most optimal one for each variant.

## Challenge 2

  - **Difficulty**: easy
  - **Goal**: Find the best
  - **Description**: You are trying to find the best performing hash function for your program. In
      the directory, there are different implementation of hash functions and different inputs.
      Test and find out which of the implementation of the hash function is the best.


## Challenge 3

  - **Difficulty**: easy
  - **Goal**: Sort the complexities
  - **Description**: The speed of the lookup depends on the used data structure. There are several
      implementation of different data structures. Sort them from the quickest to the slowest.

## Challenge 4

  - **Difficulty**: easy
  - **Goal**: Find the best
  - **Description**: You work as a security analyst in your firm. You have to secure the input
      validation of strings using a regular expression program. In the directory, there are three
      sets of regular expressions and corresponding test inputs. Find which regular expressions are
      most efficient. 


## Challenge 5

  - **Difficulty**: medium
  - **Goal**: Find and fix the bug
  - **Description**: The code contains bug or some inefficiency. Try to find it. You have a reference profile mesured for correct version of the code.

## Challenge 6

  - **Difficulty**: medium
  - **Goal**: Optimize the code 
  - **Description**: The code contains bug or some inefficiency. Try to find it. You have a reference profile mesured for correct version of the code.

## Challenge 7

  - **Difficulty**: hard
  - **Goal**: Fix the bug
  - **Description**: The directory contains a program slice taken from CPython that contains a
      programming mistake. Try to find, fix the bug and verify the bug was fixed.

## Challenge 8

  - **Difficulty**: hard
  - **Goal**: ??
  - **Description**: The directory contains a program slice taken from kernel, in particular the
      maple trees functions.
